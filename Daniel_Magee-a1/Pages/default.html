                        <p>The early game is arguably the toughest, particularly for Witcher series newbies. Taking things slowly is highly recommended as you get a feel for the game mechanics. </p>
                        <p>Key things to actively engage in: </p>
                        <ul>
                        	<li><b><span style="color: #B03A2E">LOOT:</span></b></font> Loot everything and anything. Everything has a use, and hoarding will allow for a strong mid-late game playstyle.</li>
                        	<li><b><span style="color: #B03A2E">EXPLORE:<span></b> Connected with the above, without exploring thoroughly, you will not find helpful gear for the later game.</li>
                        	<li><b><span style="color: #B03A2E">QUEST:</span></b> Complete every quest you receive! The more quests you do = the more loot found, more gold, and most importantly....Experience to level up your Geralt.</li>

                        <p>The Witcher series has a complicated, long and drawn out story. This is a main reason why the game is superior to most RPG's available today. Due to the elaborate story, the game allows players to stay engaged.</p>
                        <p>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, is a likely starting point for many players into the Witcher universe. This means that we have a lot of lore to learn about to be able to stay up-to-date!</p>
                        <p>The Witcher Universe comes from the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski's series of fantasy novels under the same name. However, while characters and locations remain the same, the actual story, within the games, divert and continue into the future.</p>

                        <p>Dodge and Roll often! While there are no <q>invisible frames</q> like in games such as Dark Souls, dodging is still crucial to staying alive in fights. As you practice and get used to the game mechanics you should find yourself predicting when the enemy will attack, and dodging accordingly.</p>
                        <p>As you progress through the game, more elaborate fighting styles become available. We will discuss these in more detail on a separate page dedicated to fighting mechanics. </p>

                        <p>Alchemy within the Witcher Universe is a key part of being a <q>Witcher</q>. The Witcher emphasizes preparation and alchemy allows for such.</p>
                        <p>By finding alchemy diagrams, finding the materials necessary to craft and then finally crafting the said alchemy item, one can gain unprecedented advantages within battle and even dialogue options.</p>
                        <p>There are three sorts of alchemy items in the Witcher 3. These are:Oils, Potions, and decoctions. Oils are used to give your sword a boost against a particular type of enemy and once crafted or upgraded can be used forever. Potions are used for many different, short-lived character buffs and once crafted never need to be again, and decoctions are similar to potions but can only be used once.</p>
