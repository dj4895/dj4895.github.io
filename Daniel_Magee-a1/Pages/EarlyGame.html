                    	you will not be finding powerful gear to help defeat those pesky monsters!</li><br>
                    	<li> Looting, then, is an important part of exploration. As, if you aren't looting the areas you explore, all is for naught.</li><br>
                    	<li> How then do you know where to look? Fortunately the game makes it somewhat easier! Check your quest log under the heading <q>Treasure</q>
                    	to follow a quest line towards powerful gear.</li><br>
                    	<li>Otherwise, while you are moving about in the game world be sure to look behind every nook and crany, and use your wither senses ability to highlight treasure chests, dead bodies etc.</li>

                		<li>It may seem obvious to follow quest lines, however, many players skip a bunch. If you really want the most out of your experience, and give yourself the biggest chance at end-game success
                		it is highly recommended to follow every single quest you come across.</li><br>
                		<li>Due to the dynamic story line within the Witcher 3: dialogue options, and decisions effect what happens to you as late as 30 hours of gameplay later in the story. For this reason; i recommend taking
                		 the noble/good-guy playstyle approach in your first play-through to diminish negative roadblocks from cropping up. </li>
